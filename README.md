#  BMI Calculator

## Our Goal

The goal of making this app was to learn more about Optionals, solidifying understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes.

## What was created

A fully funcitoning Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator was made along with a message that corresponds to the given BMI's range. The categories are marked by the colors as orange, green and red signifying low, normal and high BMI respectively.

## What was learnt

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
